LAKES FTP

DO LIKE THIS:
- log in as hadoop on cvfeeder00
- there, log in as olafd/bckermit on bcserver8
- on bcserver8 as olafd for every lake, everything must be done as sudo:

	- sudo mkdir <lake>
	- sudo mkdir <lake>/l3-10y
	- sudo mkdir <lake>/l3-yearly
		for year in [2002,...,2012]:
			- sudo mkdir <lake>/l3-yearly/year
	- sudo mkdir <lake>/l3-monthly
		for year in [2002,...,2012]:
			- sudo mkdir <lake>/l3-monthly/year
				for year in [01,...,12]:
					- sudo mkdir <lake>/l3-monthly/year/month
	sudo chown -R diversity <lake>
	sudo chmod -R a+rx <lake>
	
Then use Uwe's python rsync script with ssh olafd instead of uwe
